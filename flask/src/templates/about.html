    Parses a properly formatted .jrl file and enables reading it in a more<br />
    comfortable manner with colors that are not black and white like a

    There is an encryption algorithm implemented, guarded by a key. If you
    are<br />looking for one, chances are that you're somewhere you shouldn't be.
    Be a<br />good person and respect other's privacy.<br /><br />
    <small>The code is open source! Figure out the algorithm and brute force
    the<br />key. Or better if a ton of data is available, make out the key from
    the<br />data like a real cryptographer. The algorithm is quite simple.

      release.  You might still wanna<br />check the other pages and try to
